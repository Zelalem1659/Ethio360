        <p>ADDIS ABABA - In a groundbreaking move towards sustainable development, the Ethiopian government has unveiled an ambitious green energy initiative designed to transform the country's rural energy landscape. The program, announced by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, aims to provide clean, renewable electricity to more than 2 million rural households over the next three years.</p>
        
        <p>The initiative, dubbed "Light for All Ethiopia," will focus on solar power installations, micro-hydroelectric projects, and wind energy systems specifically designed for rural communities. This represents one of Africa's most comprehensive rural electrification programs using renewable energy sources.</p>
        
        <p>"This initiative is not just about bringing light to our rural communities," said Dr. Seleshi Bekele, Minister of Water and Energy. "It's about empowering our people with the tools they need for economic development, education, and improved quality of life."</p>
        
        <p>The program will be implemented in partnership with international development organizations and is expected to create over 50,000 jobs in the renewable energy sector. Priority will be given to regions with the lowest current electrification rates, including parts of Afar, Somali, and SNNP regions.</p>
        
        <p>Ethiopia has been making significant strides in renewable energy, with the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam expected to double the country's electricity generation capacity once fully operational.</p>

        <p>ADDIS ABABA - Ethiopian Airlines, Africa's largest and most profitable airline group, has announced the acquisition of 10 new Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners, marking a significant expansion of its long-haul capabilities and cementing its position as the continent's aviation leader.</p>
        
        <p>The new aircraft, valued at approximately $2.8 billion at list prices, will enable the airline to launch new routes to South America and expand its presence in Asia. The first aircraft is expected to be delivered in early 2026.</p>
        
        <p>CEO Mesfin Tasew announced that the expansion will create new direct connections between Africa and previously underserved destinations, including routes to São Paulo, Buenos Aires, and additional cities in China and India.</p>
        
        <p>"This acquisition represents more than just fleet expansion," said Tasew. "It's about connecting Africa to the world and bringing the world to Africa. We're building bridges that will facilitate trade, tourism, and cultural exchange."</p>

        <p>AKSUM - A team of international archaeologists has uncovered remarkable 1,500-year-old ruins near the ancient city of Aksum, providing unprecedented insights into the sophisticated trade networks and cultural practices of the Kingdom of Aksum.</p>
        
        <p>The discovery, led by Dr. Yonas Beyene from Addis Ababa University in collaboration with archaeologists from Oxford University, includes residential complexes, storage facilities, and what appears to be a marketplace dating back to the 6th century CE.</p>
        
        <p>Among the most significant finds are coins from the Byzantine Empire, pottery from India, and silk fragments believed to originate from China, providing concrete evidence of Aksum's role as a major hub in ancient global trade networks.</p>
        
        <p>"These findings confirm that Aksum was not just a regional power, but a truly cosmopolitan civilization with connections spanning from the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean," said Dr. Beyene.</p>
        
        <p>The Kingdom of Aksum, which flourished from approximately 100 to 940 CE, was one of the great powers of the ancient world, alongside Rome, Persia, and China. The civilization was known for its monumental obelisks, advanced architecture, and its early adoption of Christianity.</p>
        
        <p>The excavation site will be developed into an archaeological park, with plans to make it accessible to tourists while preserving the integrity of the discoveries. The Ethiopian Ministry of Tourism expects this to significantly boost heritage tourism in the region.</p>

        <p>The Ethiopian Coffee and Tea Authority reported that over 280,000 tons of coffee were exported, with premium varieties from regions like Yirgacheffe, Sidamo, and Harrar commanding record prices in international markets.</p>
        
        <p>Adanech Abebe, Minister of Revenue, attributed the success to improved quality control measures, direct trade relationships with international buyers, and increased awareness of Ethiopian coffee's unique flavor profiles among global consumers.</p>
        
        <p>"Coffee is more than an export commodity for Ethiopia; it's part of our cultural DNA," said Dr. Getachew Mengistie, Director General of the Ethiopian Coffee and Tea Authority. "This record achievement reflects years of investment in quality improvement and farmer support programs."</p>
        
        <p>The success story is particularly significant for Ethiopia's economy, as coffee accounts for approximately 30% of the country's total export earnings and provides livelihoods for over 15 million Ethiopians.</p>
        
        <p>New initiatives include blockchain technology for traceability, climate-smart agriculture practices, and direct trade platforms that connect Ethiopian farmers with international buyers, ensuring better prices for producers.</p>
